Class-Based Ride Sharing System
This project demonstrates a class-based ride-sharing system implemented in Smalltalk and C++. It highlights Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. The system features three main classes: Ride, Driver, and Rider, with subclasses StandardRide and PremiumRide. The implementation emphasizes modular design, secure data management, code reuse, and adaptability, supporting future system expansions.
